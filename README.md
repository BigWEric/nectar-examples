===============

Example code for working with the NeCTAR Research Cloud

SparkStressTester
=================

A project that when run, can be used to stress the host machine.
Currently a very naive implementation.

SparkCeilometerAlarmTester
==========================

A project that when run, can be used to count Ceilometer alarm calls

SparkDiskTester
=================

A project that when run, can be used to see how fast the host machine accesses it's storage.

Currently a very naive implementation.

To run it simply use the heat template in the heat subdirectory.
